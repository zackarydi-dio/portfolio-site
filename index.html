        <p>
            My career goal is to build a strong foundation in business analytics and information systems
            by gaining hands-on experience in data analysis, systems management, and technology-driven decision making.
            I aim to work in roles that allow me to analyze data, improve business processes,
            and support organizations in making informed, strategic decisions. 
            I hope to grow into a position where I can bridge the gap between technology and business,
            using data and information systems to drive efficiency, innovation, and long-term success.
